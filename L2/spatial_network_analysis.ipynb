Similar approach can be used for constructing routable graphs from many different data sources, such as Digiroad which is the national street database in Finland. Naturally the code needs to be adjusted to reflect the data structure of Digiroad or any other street network data that you want to use. You need to have some information about the allowed driving directions as well as the from and to-ids for each edge. These ids are not necessarily present in the data by default. In such cases, you can create your own ids e.g. based on vertices of the edge geometries (i.e. the x-y coordinates of the vertices can be used to create a unique node-id). "

Naturally this is not typically possible because of the congestion. Considering congestion in the travel times can also be taken into account by creating a model that integrates information from floating car measurements (GPS data), but it is out of scope of this tutorial.
